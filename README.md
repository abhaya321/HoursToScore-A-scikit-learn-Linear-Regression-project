# Linear Regression: Hours vs Scores

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model using **scikit-learn** to predict student scores based on study hours.  
I built this project to strengthen my understanding of the **linear regression concept** in Machine Learning.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Dataset: Hours studied vs. Exam scores  
- Goal: Predict exam scores given the number of study hours  
- Model: Simple Linear Regression (using scikit-learn)  
- Visualization: Matplotlib/Seaborn plots to show regression line and data points  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib / seaborn  

## 🚀 Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Visualize the relationship between hours and scores  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train a Linear Regression model  
5. Evaluate performance with metrics (e.g., R², MAE)  
6. Make predictions  

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
Through this project, I gained:
- Hands-on practice with **Linear Regression** in scikit-learn  
- Understanding of how a model learns the relationship between features and targets  
- Experience in training, testing, and evaluating a regression model  

*This is a beginner-friendly ML project for concept building.*
